1) Add new learning algorithm (MPO, PPO, TRPO) - Ben 
2) Evaluate learned policies on pure environment - Khalil 
3) Evaluate learned policies with different mass values - Khalil
4) Evaluate learned policies with manual adversary - Julie? 
5) (If time but probably not) Train and get learning curves with different strengths of adversary (will probably take lots of computation time but could be cool)
6) Report - Khalil, Julie, Ben
7) Video - Khalil, Julie, Ben
